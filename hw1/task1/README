Type "make" to build.

The following functions are defined:

rank_support(const bitvector& b_in): construct a rank support object, takes a reference to a bitvector (ie a compact_vector<unsigned long,1>)
void insert(uint64_t ind): insert a 1 into the rank support bitvector and update the precomputed values.
uint64_t rank1(uint64_t ind): returns the number of 1s in the bitvector up to and including the given index.
uint64_t operator()(uint64_t ind): a wrapper for the rank1 function
uint64_t overhead(): returns the number of bits used by the rank support object
void save(const std::string& fname): save this rank support object to a file with name fname
void load(const std::string& fname): load this rank support object from a file with name fname, current data in the rank support will be replaced
void load(std::ifstream& infile): same as the other load, but takes an open ifstream rather than an fname
void print_members(): prints the arrays in this rank support object to stdout.
