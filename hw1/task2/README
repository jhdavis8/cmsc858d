Type "make" to build.

The following functions are defined:

select_support(const rank_support& r_in): construct a select support object, takes a reference to a rank support object.
uint64_t select1(uint64_t ind): returns the index of the ind-th 1 in the bitvector
uint64_t operator()(uint64_t ind): a simple operator overload for parens which wraps select1
uint64_t overhead(): returns the number of bits used to store this select support object
void save(const std::string& fname): save this select support object to disk to a file called fname
void load(const std::string& fname): load data into this select support object from a file called fname
